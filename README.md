# Gitlab CLI

Config files for a joat based cli, you don't know what is joat? ðŸ˜±
get your shit together and go [read about joat!](https://github.com/sennav/joat)

For now this cli is focused in managing tickets, but nothing stops it to expand to other gilab APIs.
It's also very specific to my needs so let me know if you are using this so I can make it more generic.

## Instalation

In a near future:

```
joat install sennav/gitlab
```

For now just clone this repo in your home folder with under the folder `.gitlab.joat` and create a symlink in your path name `gitlab` pointing to your `joat` binary.

## Usage

It's used like a regular CLI, here's the help with the commands:
